### Project Description:
The Vuejs-Store project is a basic online store application built using Vue.js. It includes features such as product listing, product details, shopping cart functionality, and checkout process.

- **Vue Fragment**: This feature in Vue 3 allows for multiple root elements in a template, eliminating the need for a top-level element.
- **Teleport Component**: This feature in Vue 3 enables placing HTML elements anywhere in the DOM tree, making it useful for dialog and modal components.
- **<script setup>**: This experimental feature in Vue 3 provides a sugar syntax for using Composition API inside Single File Components (SFCs).
